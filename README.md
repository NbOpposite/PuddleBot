# PuddleBot
A Rain themed bot for the Rain fan discord server

This bot is intended as a single server bot that you self host. but that's really only because the permissions system only supports one server

This was initially designed to replicate the most used features of the Kaminari bot, but in time I hope to add more unique features

### To use
Fill in the Token and owner parts of the example config (and the yt-api in order to use the yt command), then rename it to config.json
